<p>Yackety Yacc allows you to take long urls and shave them to make them
postable via twitter or any other service that limits the number of
characters you are allowed to use in a message.  It makes
communication via long urls much simpler.  Yackety Yacc is an
experiment in the <a href="http://github.com/weavejester/compojure">
Compojure Web Framework</a> powered by the wonderful <a href="clojure.org">Clojure</a> 
language.</p>

<p><b>Terms of Use:</b><br />
Yackety Yacc is a free service meant for good, not spam.  Reports of
abuse will cause your url to be removed without warning.  In other
words, just play nice and you can have all the happy shortened urls
you want!  Neither Yackety Yacc or Aaron Bedra offers any warranty of
any kind.</p>
